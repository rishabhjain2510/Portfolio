                <h2>My Experience with CodroidHub</h2>
                <p>I'm currently part of CodroidHub's Data Analytics Program, a job-oriented training designed to turn technical skills into real-world solutions. The program blends Python, SQL, Power BI, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing with a strong emphasis on hands-on, project-based learning ‚Äî making every concept immediately applicable.</p>
                
                <p>I'm currently working on a DNA Sequence Analysis Toolkit ‚Äî a bioinformatics pipeline that processes raw genetic sequences, cleans and analyzes the data, visualizes meaningful patterns, and applies machine learning models to detect potential genetic markers and predict biological traits. This toolkit streamlines the process from raw DNA input to actionable research insights, offering real value in bioinformatics and life sciences.</p>
                
                <p>This journey is more than skill-building ‚Äî it's training me to think end-to-end, from data collection to deployment, and giving me the confidence to create data-driven solutions that make a tangible impact in healthcare, genetics, and scientific research.</p>
